# Drupal 8.4.x + Composer
_**(...and CircleCI, and Pantheon, and...)**_

This project is a Drupal 8 codebase based on [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project), [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold), [pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer), plus the changes I had to make to be able to upgrade to the 4.x branch of Drupal 8 -- a process that wasn't *super* easy, b/c of some gaps in my knowledge, and oh btw the 4.x branch relies on a newer major version of Symfony :D  FWIW, this d.o thread was extremely helpful for me: https://www.drupal.org/node/2874827 (Drush 8.x doesn't install Drupal 8.4.x and Drush master doesn't install Drupal 8.3.x)

CU Bear distro packages: https://packagist.org/packages/cubear/

**Note:** This distro uses the Bootstrap-based custom theme [cwd_base_bootstrap](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/cwd_base_bootstrap), and the custom admin theme [cwd_admin](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/cwd_admin).  Please take care in updating these theme packages on "child sites" built from this starter kit.

## What's inside

* `drupal-composer/drupal-project`
* upgraded Drupal core to 8.4.0-beta1
  * which included changes to composer.json from the regular drupal-composer/drupal-project
    * ps this was somewhat of a nightmare -- apparently 8.4.0 requires a newer major version of symfony, and that caused all sorts of pain...
    * this thread was one of my main resources: https://www.drupal.org/node/2874827
* custom theme packages (included via composer)
* added some of the pantheon files from [pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer)
* added all config from our working demo site (omitted link)
  * (if you work with me, ping me and I'll give you the site UUID for importing the config)
* @todo: add a few more details from what's on confluence (i.e. ctypes)

### See also

Refer to the [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) README for more info about that project template, and how to use it (and therefore how to use this project).

Refer to the [pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin) README for more info about using `terminus build:project:create` (below) and other `build` funtionality.

## Usage

### Basic
**NOTE:** For best results, make sure your Drush version is updated to the latest stable version, Drush 8.1.12.

1. `git clone git@github.com:CU-CommunityApps/cubear-starter-kit.git ajm-cubear-vanilla`
1. `cd ajm-cubear-vanilla`
1. `composer install`
1. Then install drupal using the *config_installer* install profile (via UI, or `drush`).

**That's it! :)**  Enjoy your new Drupal 8.4.x + composer site!

### For a Pantheon site
(i.e. on Pantheon but without the GH/CircleCI jazz)

These instructions are similar to "Basic," but unfinished :)  @todo: Basically, create an empty pantheon site, clone the repo down, completely replace the code with the code from THIS repo, run composer install, update .gitignore so you can commit all those composer-generated artifacts to the repo, push back to pantheon, and then proceed with the process above -- using terminus drush commands, and skipping the "cd" commands of course; probably will need to wipe the database that was created by the Pantheon "drops 8" install, before anything else; may need to edit the "upstream" setting for the site from `drops-8` to `empty`. (If necessary, add back in the site UUID manipulation steps that used to be in the "Basic" instructions.)

### Vanilla-er

The `vvanilla` branch is a much plainer codebase -- no config or Pantheon files -- see my [commit #7d4a62e message](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/cubear-starter-kit/commit/1de45592d7780a2aa0fe16943078b4771ec73c25) for more info.

### Pantheon + GH + CircleCI instructions
1. Prerequisites: Terminus (1.x) and `terminus-build-tools-plugin` -- need to use 2.x branch (as of 2017-08-22 there's a 2.0.0-alpha2 tag).
1. **IMPORTANT:** When you're done, do **NOT** make changes/commits to your new site codebase from the GH interface -- there's a .gitignore thing from the Pantheon template, that's totally on-purpose, but it means that files will be lost if you commit in GH, so we might need to undo that, idk yet.
1. Other heads-ups:
    1. You'll be prompted for GitHub and CircleCI personal access tokens, but the prompts have documentation links, so just follow those as you go along.
        1. Alternatively, you can set your tokens ahead of time like this:
    https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin/tree/2.0.0-alpha2#credentials
    1. You'll also be prompted for a password for "user 1" on the new site you're about to create; personally, I leave it blank and use `drush user-login` after installation, i.e.<br />
    `terminus drush ajm-cubear-vanilla.dev -- uli`
        1. "user 1" username will be "admin."
    1. **IMPORTANT:** While most of the build takes care of itself, toward the end you'll get two "authenticity of host can't be established" prompts -- make sure you type "yes"!!
1. Create or edit ~/.terminus/config.yml (in your local env), to add a "starter site shortcut" [like these examples](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin/tree/2.0.0-alpha2#starter-site-shortcuts).
    1. Mine contains the following:<br />
    ```
    command:
      build:
        project:
          create:
            shortcuts:
              cubear-starter-kit: cubear/drupal-8-starter-kit:dev-master
    ```
1. Then, run `terminus build:project:create` with the applicable options -- my command looks like this:<br />
`terminus build:project:create --team="cornell-university-cornell-information-technologies" --org="CU-CommunityApps" --admin-email="cd-drupal-l@list.cornell.edu" cubear-starter-kit ajm-cubear-vanilla`
    1. Full documentation is over in the `terminus-build-tools-plugin` README, but briefly: `--org` is to set the child site's GitHub repo to be owned by an org (if you leave the option off, it will be owned by your personal GitHub account -- you can always transfer ownership to later), `--admin-email` is the email to use for Drupal user 1 (defaults to your personal GitHub account email) `cubear-starter-kit` is the shortcut we set in the previous step, and `ajm-cubear-vanilla` is the name of your new Pantheon site and GitHub repo.
1. Now, clone the repo FROM github to your local, do work locally, and push changes back up to github -- that will trigger CircleCI builds, and eventual merging of changes into "dev" on Pantheon.
    1. OR, better, yet, create a new branch locally and use a Pull Request workflow :)

### Next steps
* Optionally, update the README in your new site repo with the CircleCI badge, so that it's easier to get from your repo to that project's CircleCI things (for some reason the badge isn't getting automatically added right now).  You can get the "status badge" embed code by going to your project on CircleCI ([example](https://circleci.com/gh/alisonjo2786/ajm-cubear-vanilla)) > settings gear at top-right > "status badge" in left sidebar menu.
* Configure redis https://pantheon.io/docs/redis/ (enable the add-on in Pantheon, update settings.php, enable the Drupal module)
* Enable NewRelic in Pantheon.
* Enable daily/weekly backups in Pantheon (if service level allows).
* Check your "Basic site settings" (admin/config/system/site-information) and Update Manager settings (admin/reports/updates/settings).

@todo: add instructions for updating/contributing to this starter kit
@todo: mention possible "Ivy" distro

### Pull Request workflow
_(Open to changes!)_
1. Fork this repo to your own account, i.e. `alisonjo2786/cubear-starter-kit`.
1. Clone your fork locally.  **DO NOT** make commits in the GitHub UI (b/c .gitignore things).
1. Add and rename remotes...
    1. `git rename origin ajmfork`
        1. **Maybe** run `git remote -v` first, to confirm the name of your repo fork remote (in case it isn't "origin").
    1. `git remote add cu-community-repo git@github.com:CU-CommunityApps/cubear-starter-kit.git`
1. Make sure you're up to date with all the latest things:<br />
`git remote update`
1. Create a new branch where you'll do your work, **from the main repo:**<br />
`git checkout -b news-date-field cu-community-repo/master`
1. Work.
1. Commit changes.
1. Check the main repo in case other changes have been committed in the meantime -- if changes **have** been committed in the meantime, rebase your copy of the repo with those changes:<br />
`git remote update`<br />
`git rebase cu-community-repo/master` <-- Grabs commits from the main repo, inserts them into your branch, and sticks your local commit(s) on the end.
1. Push branch up to your fork -- so now, `alisonjo2786/cubear-starter-kit` has a branch called `news-date-field`.
1. In GitHub, go to the branch on your fork, and start a pull request.<br />
"Your recently pushed branches" > "Compare & pull request"
    1. Check the two branches that GitHub is presenting to you -- the desired setup is for "base fork" to be the main repo ("CU-CommunityApps/cubear-starter-kit" > "master"), and for the "head fork" to be your fork ("alisonjo2786/cubear-starter-kit" > "news-date-field").
    1. Add whatever description/comment.
    1. Submit the PR.
1. @todo: determine and describe code review and approval process...
1. If you have permission to update/commit to the main repo, technically you can merge the PR into the main repo, but proper devops is for someone other than you to review and merge.

#### Demo site
_(The following is my process right now; very, very open to suggestions!)_
1. Go to your local copy of `gold-bear` repo.
1. One-time: (initial setup)
    1. Add a secondary remote to the main `cubear-starter-kit` repo:<br />
    `git remote add cubear-starter-kit git@github.com:CU-CommunityApps/cubear-starter-kit.git`
    1. Create a branch that tracks `cubear-starter-kit` > `master`:<br />
    `git checkout -b sk-master --track cubear-starter-kit/master`
1. Go to branch that tracks the main repo.
1. Pull from the main repo to this branch:<br />
@todo: check this, I'm guessing from memory, may be wrong command.<br />
`git pull cubear-starter-kit` _(may be like, git fetch nameofremote, or may be something else -- check it!)_
1. Check the commits that come in -- like, browse the whole log, or look for the commit(s) you know you want to add to the demo site.  Make note of the commit sha/hash details that you need.
1. Go back to `master` and create a new branch for the changes (yep, another PR coming! get excited!):<br />
`git checkout -b coffee-update`
1. Cherry pick the commits from the starter-kit tracking branch (`sk-master`) -- personally, I prefer to use `-x` for cherry-picks, i.e.<br />
`git cherry-pick -x a1s2d3f4g5h6jcommithash`
1. Push the branch up to the `gold-bear` repo, create a pull request, do pull request things.
    1. **Keep an eye on CircleCI** -- it will do a build for the new branch, and the PR, and when the PR is merged into master.
    1. When the process is done, the commits in the PR will have been merged into dev/master on Pantheon, too -- then you can `drush cim` or whatever.
        1. If it's just composer updates that are needed, those will be handled by the build tools stuff that Pantheon does.

#### git remote config tips
* Rename your remotes to minimize confusion, i.e.<br />
```@todo```
* If you're updating the `gold-bear` demo site, too, add a secondary remote to your local copy of that repo, and an extra branch that tracks the starter-kit repo, so you can pull down starter-kit code updates and then grab applicable commits as needed.  In other words:<br />
```@todo```
